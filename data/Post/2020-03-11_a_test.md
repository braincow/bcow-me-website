This entry has been created into the 'master' branch of a Git repository. This Git repository, hosted in Google Source Repositories, is monitored by a Cloud Build trigger. Trigger gets executed when new commits are pushed to the remote 'master' branch. Cloud Build executes Python container into which static website compiler 'statik' is installed via Pip and html files are generated with it that are then copied with a gsutil container to the Storage bucket that hosts this site.

Fancy.
